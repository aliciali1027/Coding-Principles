1.The DRY Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself
===
How to Achieve DRY
--
To avoid violating the DRY principle, divide your system into pieces. Divide your code and logic into smaller reusable units and use that code by calling it where you want. Don't write lengthy methods, but divide logic and try to use the existing piece in your method.

One good example of the DRY principle is the helper class in enterprise libraries, in which every piece of code is unique in the libraries and helper classes.
